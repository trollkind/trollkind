Born 1979, I had a blast programming in Turbo Pascal, creating little games after school. Working as a Compositor since 2005 and been scripting in Lua and Python for the compositing software and rendermanagers. Did a C++ course but never really coded in that language. Learned Blueprints in the Unreal Engine for some UI work. Now on to Kotlin for some freelancing App development and maybe games too. Hopefully some Minecraft modding, if time and money allow.
